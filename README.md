# S2DL: A Superpixel-based and Spatially-regularized Diffusion Learning Method for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Clustering

This code is an implementation of **Superpixel-based and Spatiallyregularized Diffusion Learning** proposed in "Superpixel-based and Spatially-regularized Diffusion Learning Method for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Clustering", see [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15447). S2DL can be used as a clustering method for remote sensing datasets.

S2DL uses several Matlab Toolboxes, such as [Entropy Rate Superpixel](https://github.com/mingyuliutw/EntropyRateSuperpixel), and [Diffusion Learning](https://github.com/sampolk/DiffusionLearning).
